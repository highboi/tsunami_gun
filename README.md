# Tsunami: The Web 3.0 Protocol

![Tsunami Logo](https://github.com/highboi/tsunami/blob/master/tsunami_logo.png)

Tsunami aims to be a web protocol for the new age. The goal is to enable any website to be converted into a web 3.0 site using WebRTC to create P2P network storage natively on the browser.
WebRTC is used to synchronize data and files. Files are stored as blob URIs in cookies and data is also stored as cookies. Tsunami makes web 3.0 possible using browser-only technology, so
no extra software or frameworks are necessary.
